# Introduction to Python
## Coding Challenges for Basic Python

### Installation
The project should run without needing any external dependancies. The 'requirements.txt` has been included for developers who are familiar with virtual encironments. To install, run the following command from the project root: 

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Tests can be run by running `test.py`, either in IDLE or the terminal of your choice. The tests will fail at first, but this is to be expected as the code to solve them has not been written yet.

### Solving the Challenges
The code for satisfying the tests should be written in the appropriate file in the `src` directory (the code for the strings tests in `strings.py` etc.).

The functions have already been set out. To solve the tests, simply complete the `return` statement for each function.
